    <h2> Q.1 What is JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>
      JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web page every
    time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely
    content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

    <br><br>
    JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

    <br><br>

    <h2> Q.2 What is the use of isNaN function ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true
    if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number. isNaN() Method.

    nal ceractor jo he vo empty tag ke dara work karta he.

    You can use this, for example, to test whether an argument to a function is arithmetically processable and handle
    values that are not number-like by throwing an error, providing a default value, etc. This way, you can have a
    function that makes use of the full versatility JavaScript provides by implicitly converting values depending on
    context.

    <br><br>


    <h2> Q.3 What is negative Infinity ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    NEGATIVE_INFINITY : is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function
    generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than
    -Number. MAX_VALUE) .
    <br><br>
    JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .

    <br><br>

    If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.
    The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.
    The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
    The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.4 Which company developed JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as
    a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.

    <br><br>

    After its release, more and more browsers started adding JavaScript support. Still, for much of its history
    JavaScript was not regarded as a serious programming language. Its earliest releases suffered from notable
    performance and security issues, but developers had no alternatives. If they wanted to run programs in the browser,
    they had to use JavaScript.

    <br><br>

    Soon after, Ryan Dahl released an open-source, cross-platform environment called Node.js. It provided a way to run
    JavaScript code from outside a browser.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.5 What are undeclared and undefined variables ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a
    keyword. Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using
    the var or const keyword.

    <br><br>

    If we use typeof operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with the return
    value as undefined. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.


    <br><br>
    <h2>Q.6 Write the code for adding new elements dynamically ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    Javascript is a very important language when it comes to learning how the browser works. Often there are times we
    would like to add dynamic elements/content to our web pages. This post deals with all of that.

    <br><br>

   <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 20px;"> Example :</span>

    Elements can be created based on some event like a click. Here an example of how to create elements dynamically with
    an onclick event. This code can be further made into a todo-list!

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.7 What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state
    management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content
    from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level.

    <br><br>

    It is known that the web is stateless, which means every time a specific webpage is requested. It is recreated each
    time and posted to the server. Also, HTTP is a stateless protocol, i.e. it cannot hold client information on the
    webpage. So it need to maintain the state of a page and the server-side as well, State management is done. ViewState
    and SessionState are used for client-side state management and server-side state management respectively

    <br><br>

    It is maintained at only one level that is page-level

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.8 What is === operator ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    JavaScript Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of
    operands are the same. Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but
    their type is different the operation will return false.

    <h2>Q.9 How can the style/class of an element be changed ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    In this article, we will learn how we can change the style/class of an element. If you want to build a cool
    websiteor app then UI plays an important role. We can change, add or remove any CSS property from an HTML element on
    theoccurrence of any event with the help of JavaScript. There are two common approaches that allow us to achieve
    this task.

    You can use the below-mentioned methods to add classes, remove classes, and toggle between different classes
    respectively.


    <br><br>
    <h2>Q.10 How to read and write a file using JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    On the client side, you can’t read or write files in JavaScript browsers. The fs module in Node.js may be used to
    <br>
    accomplish this on the server-side. It has methods for reading and writing files on the file system that are both
    <br>
    synchronous and asynchronous. Let’s demonstrate some examples of reading and writing files with the node.js fs <br>
    module. <br>

    1. file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content. <br>
    2. str = fread file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file. <br>
    3. file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing. <br>


    <h2>Q.11 What are all the looping structures in JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions
    repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. For example, suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times.
    This can be done in two ways as shown below: <br>

    first : Iterative Method
    <br>

    Many things may seem confusing to you in the above program at this point of time but do not worry you will be able
    to understand everything about loops in JavaScript by the end of this tutorial. You can observe that in the above
    program using loops, we have used the console.log statement only once but still, the output of the program will be
    the same as that of the iterative program where we have used the console.log statement 10 times. In computer
    programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.12 How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or value to an
    integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the second argument of the
    parseInt() function

    <h2>Q.13 What is the function of the delete operator ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    This article is going to discuss the delete operator available in JavaScript. Delete is comparatively a lesser-known
    operator in JavaScript. This operator is more specifically used to delete JavaScript object properties.

    <br>

    The JavaScript pop(), shift(), or splice() methods are available to delete an element from an array. But because of
    the key-value pair in an object, deleting is more complicated. Note that, the delete operator only works on objects
    and not on variables or functions. <br>

    As the above picture shows, delete person.phone returns true and logging the person object shows that the phone
    property doesn’t exist anymore.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.14 What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">Alert Box : </span><br>
    It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert box is displayed to the user, the user
    needs to press ok and proceed.

    Prompt Box : <br>
    It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further use. After entering the required details
    user have to click ok to proceed next stage else by pressing the cancel button user returns the null value.

    Confirm Box : <br>
    It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or permission from the user. The user has to press the
    ok or cancel button to proceed.

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.15 What is the use of Void (0) ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term
    “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while
    inserting an expression in a web page.
    <br>

    This expression returns undefined primitive value. This is often used with hyperlinks. Sometimes, you will decide to
    call some JavaScript from inside a link. Normally, when you click a link, the browser loads a brand new page or
    refreshes the same page (depending on the URL specified).
    <br>

    But you most likely don’t desire this to happen if you have hooked up some JavaScript thereto link. To prevent the
    page from refreshing, you could use void(0).

    <br><br>

    <h2>Q.16 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">Approach :</span> <br>
    We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a
    reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of
    a window by accessing it.
    <br><br>

    So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location Object inside Javascript we can change the URL
    of our window and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our Javascript without any href tag. We will build a
    small working sample to learn it practically.

    <h2>Q.17 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript ? </h2>

    == >
    <br><br>

    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, through the HTML we can design a block of webpages. <br><br>

    1) Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved. <br>
    2) Replacement is done everywhere. <br>
    3) It is not possible to append innerHTML. <br>
    4) Breaks the document. <br>
    5) Used for Cross-site Scripting.
