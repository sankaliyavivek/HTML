    <h2> Q.2 How to embed audio and video in a webpage ? </h2>

    == > 
    <br>

    <p>Add audio and video elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them source elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it. These should include type attributes</p>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to properly display the content on the screen. So, in this article, we will learn how to embed audio and video in HTML. In order to insert multimedia files on web pages, we already know how to insert images in HTML. </p>

    <p>To embed audio in HTML, we use the audio tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.</p>


    <h2> Q.3 Semantic element in HTML5 ? </h2>

    == > 
    <br>

    <p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: nav,header and footer to indicate navigation, header, and footer.</p>

    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer . </p>
    
    <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content . </p>

    <p>HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed . </p>

    <p>Where the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer . </p>

    <p>As HTML5 is still relatively new, this use of non-semantic elements is still very common on websites today.</p>


    <h2> Q.4 Canvas and SVG tags ? </h2>

    == > 
    <br><br>

    <b>Canvas : </b> 

    <p>Single element similar to img in behavior. Canvas diagram can be saved to PNG or JPG format</p>

    <p>Give better performance with larger number of objects or smaller surface, or both</p>

    <p>Poor scalability. Not suitable for printing on higher resolution. Pixelation may occur</p>

    <p>It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene. There are several methods in canvas to draw paths, boxes, circles, text and add images.</p>

    <p>A canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. JavaScript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to those of other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics. Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition . </p>

    <p>Interacting with the canvas involves obtaining the canvas' rendering context, which determines whether to use the canvas API, WebGL, or WebGL2 rendering context . </p>

    <b>SVG : </b> 

    <p>SVG : Scalable Vector Graphics </p>

    <p>svg img app jpg,pnk yaa kisi bhi format me dounload kar sakte he . </p>

    <p>svg img app dounload karoge to vo aap ko high quality at any resolution provide karegi .</p>

    <p>SVG images can contain hyperlinks to other documents . </p>

    <p>An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.</p>

    <p>SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by the most-used web browsers.</p>
